[go.tufts.io](http://go.tufts.io) is a project under [tufts.io](http://tufts.io) and is built and managed by [Richard Kim](http://cwrichardkim.com) (with help from [Max Bernstein](http://bernsteinbear.com/)).  Inspired by internal linking tools at companies like Microsoft and Google, go/ allows anyone at tufts to create short-links that forward to other destinations.

Some cool use-cases include linking to important google docs, linking to websites with obscure names (like heroku apps), linking to personal portfolios, linking to photoshopped imgur links of ming, etc.  I am currently working on getting go/ to forward to go.tufts.io, so that when someone on tufts wifi goes to go/11, it will forward to the comp 11 website.

## Goals

1. Have go/ links be so common in Tufts CS that people say stuff like "yea, go to slash <projectname>"
2. Encourage people to create github accounts and get a few easy commits into a significant repository
3. Make sharing important links easier / more memorable -> higher likelihood of people remember each other's projects and potentially sharing them or collaborating

## Prerequisite knowledge

Basically none.  I took COMP120 but I'm pretty hopeless at web coding, so most of this is me just fumbling around until I figure something out.  Max put me down the road of using a static website generator like Jekyll instead of creating and maintaing a server.  I think that if these tools (go/ included) really hit a stride, then it might be necessary to move to a more traditional web app model.  I am super happy with how fast the service is though since Github just generates static pages.

## Past hurdles

Getting jekyll to do what I want.  Picking a good template to base my work off of.  Stripping all the unnecessary code and features from those templates.  Getting javascript to do what I want.

## Future hurdles

Finding good admins who care about the quality of the project.  Getting go/ to forward to go.tufts.io.  Finding non-seniors to pass the project on to.

## Important resources

Ming, Mike Bauer, Max Bernstein.  Basically having a network of people where you can bounce ideas off of and who are unafraid to tell you your ideas are stupid (but persisting anyway).
