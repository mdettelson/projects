projects.tufts.io is a project under tufts.io, built and managed by [Richard Kim](http://cwrichardkim.com).  The concept is to encourage people to see what projects are happening at Tufts, learn more about what resources those projects found useful, and to eventually add to the list.

I believe that an important part of completing a project is to have external motivation.  Most people have ideas, work on them, get tired of them, and give up.  Having someone else know about the project and expect a result from you vastly increases the chances that the project will continue beyond that first moment of lost interest.

Hopefully, posting on projects.tufts.io will become something of an external motivation.  Tagging your project as "dead" or having people ask you about your project may encourage you to take a few extra steps until the next wave of motivation hits.

## Goals

The biggest goal is persistence of the website.  I suspect that it'll probably die off pretty quickly, but I'm hoping that one or two really great posts will act as a great reference for someone, who then goes on to finish a project and post it.

## Prerequisite knowledge

Basically none.  I took COMP120 but I'm pretty hopeless at web coding, so most of this is me just fumbling around until I figure something out.  Max put me down the road of using a static website generator like Jekyll instead of creating and maintaing a server.  I think that if these tools (go/ included) really hit a stride, then it might be necessary to move to a more traditional web app model.

## Past hurdles

Getting jekyll to do what I want.  Picking a good template to base my work off of.  Stripping all the unnecessary code and features from those templates.

## Future hurdles

The biggest one is getting content on the website.  It's the chicken and egg problem.  Until the website becomes useful, nobody will post, but the website doesn't become useful until people post.  I hope that go.tufts.io takes off, effectively bringing tufts.io with it, which then makes projects.tufts.io relevant
