tufts.io is an attempt to encourage building projects at Tufts.

Current projects under tufts.io are:
- [tufts.io](http://tufts.io)
- [go.tufts.io](http://go.tufts.io) - short links for tufts
- [projects.tufts.io](http://projects.tufts.io) - see current and past projects at Tufts

Planned projects include:
- api.tufts.io - an API for all things Tufts
- people.tufts.io - a directory for people to add themselves and include what resources they found most useful
- classes.tufts.io - an inside look at how the tufts community sees cs / design / els classes
- feedback.tufts.io - an honest and anonymous way to give feedback to any element of tufts (departments, student groups, classes, etc)

## Goals

1. Allow people to find success outside of the typical big-company path (Google, Apple, Microsoft)
2. Nudge projects to be more interdisciplinary
3. Help a few motivated people build what they want to build
4. Encourage stupid ideas

## Prerequisite knowledge

Basically none.  I took COMP120 but I'm pretty hopeless at web coding, so most of this is me just fumbling around until I figure something out.  Max put me down the road of using a static website generator like Jekyll instead of creating and maintaing a server.

## Past hurdles

Breaking into google calendar so that it doesn't look like google calendar

## Future hurdles

Branding.  It's not super clear what tufts.io is yet, and I'm hoping that the hackathon + future branding efforts can change that.  A lot of the time, I think branding is more or less fluff.  While it can be super important and lead to make or break moments, sometimes it's just wasted effort telling people what you're doing instead of actually doing it.  It's tough trying to strike a balance between knowing when to work on this and when to focus on telling people what it is.

## Important resources

Ming.
